          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Commonly used elements to add content to pages: Text, Image, Header, List Elements</li>
          <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on a page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers. Common elemet types that are used to divide and describe are: Meta-related, Content division, Semantic Elements</li>
          <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the head and body elements</li>
            <dd>- The <i><b>head</i></b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <i>head</i> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</dd>
            <dd>- The <i><b>body</i></b> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</dd>
          <li>List Items:</li>
            <dd>- ul-unordered list</dd>
            <dd>- ol-Ordered lists</dd>
          <li>There are also header tags that are needed in the body of an html document.</li>
