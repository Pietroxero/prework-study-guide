        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Commonly used elements to add content to pages: Text, Image, Header, List Elements</li>
          <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on a page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers. Common elemet types that are used to divide and describe are: Meta-related, Content division, Semantic Elements</li>
          <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the head and body elements</li>
            <dd>- The <i><b>head</i></b> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <i>head</i> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</dd>
            <dd>- The <i><b>body</i></b> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</dd>
          <li>List Items:</li>
            <dd>- ul-unordered list</dd>
            <dd>- ol-Ordered lists</dd>
          <li>There are also header tags that are needed in the body of an html document.</li>
          <li>Headers are numbers 1-6 with H going before the number.</li>
          <li><b>Metadata</b>:
            <dd>- Data about or webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</dd>
            <dd>- Typically not seen by users, but i contains important information about accessibility, search engine, and performance.</dd>
          <li>Inside the <i>head</i> element, we can use the following metadata tags:</li>
            <dd>Style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</dd>
            <dd>Base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</dd>
            <dd>Link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</dd>
            <dd>Script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</dd>
          </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use <b>inline CSS</b>. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>a selector <i><b>div</b></i> defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply</li>
