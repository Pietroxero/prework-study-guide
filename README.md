# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created not due to requirement of the course work, more to help develop my skills and knowledge base in a new language and skill trade for a better career path than my current everyday role. The problem that I am trying to solve for is 
advancing my skill set. As it stands currently with the prework I have learned and refreshed my memory of certain languages and fucntions through HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## Usage

This prework can be used as a guided reference, while it will not contain thorough notes on every single thing I learn in this course, it will have pointed sections that can be refered to for definitions and more to go back and review for further information. Topics such as HTML elements, Javascript variables.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
